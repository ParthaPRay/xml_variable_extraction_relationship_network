## Overview

**XMLVERNIv1** is a powerful tool designed to:
1. **Extract variables** from XML files.
2. **Analyze relationships** between variables using various similarity measures.
3. **Visualize interactive networks** of variable relationships for better insights.

This software offers **intuitive processing** and **state-of-the-art similarity techniques** to illustrate the underlying relationships within XML data.

---

## Key Features

- **Variable Extraction**: Parse and extract variables from any XML file.
- **Similarity Measures**:
  - Jaccard Similarity
  - Levenshtein Distance
  - Cosine Similarity
  - Semantic Similarity (using `SentenceTransformer`)
- **Interactive Visualization**: Generates interactive, community-aware relationship networks using `pyvis`.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple UI powered by **Gradio** for seamless interaction.

## Technical Specifications

### Input
- **XML File**: Upload or use the default `example.xml`.

### Processing Techniques
- **Jaccard Similarity**: Measures the overlap between character sets of two strings.
- **Levenshtein Distance**: Calculates the minimum number of edits required to transform one string into another.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Uses TF-IDF vectorization for character-based similarity.
- **Semantic Similarity**: Leverages `SentenceTransformer` for contextual embedding-based similarity.

### Output
- **Textual Results**: Lists of extracted variables and similar pairs.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Relationship networks with node clustering.
